RP15 was produced by members of [IEA Wind Task 32](http://community.ieawind.org/task32/) in 2013. 

# Version 1.0
The first version of RP 15 was released in January 2013. A PDF of that document is [included in this repository as the 1.0 release](./../../releases/tag/1.0).

# How to provide feedback to the Recommended Practice
There are two ways to provide feedback to RP15.

## Through Github
You can provide feedback to RP 15 by [raising an issue](./../../issues). Before you raise an issue, please take a few minutes to check if there is a similar one in the list already.

**You will have to be logged in to Github to provide feedback**. This means that your feedback will be associated with your username, which may make it possible to identify you. We prefer to have feedback associated with a name because RP15 is a community document.
